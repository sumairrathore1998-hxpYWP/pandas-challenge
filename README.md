The testing data of 461 9th graders at Thomas High School was turned into null data, which recalculated the percentages of passing math, passing reading, and the overall passing. The total count of students did not change as that was run on the count of the student id.
1.	The overall passing rate for Thomas High School changed dramatically from 91% to 65%.
2.	Thomas High School's ranking dropped from 2nd to 8th in the district of 15 campuses.
3.	Data at the grade level will now show as "NaN" in reports for the 9th grade students at Thomas High School
4.	In addition to the overall passing rate, the campus math and reading averages and passing percentages all saw shifts.
The major changes will be seen at the lower views of the disaggregated data with minor impact to the larger data views.
